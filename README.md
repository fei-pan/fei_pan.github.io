# 路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索

Hi there, my name is PAN Fei (潘飞), a postdoctoral researcher at the Hong Kong Centre for Cerebro-Cardiovascular Health Engineering Limited (COCHE) located in the City University of Hong Kong.

This is my personal webpage. I am leaving Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, etc., but still need someplace to tell people how to find me and what happened to me recently.

For reaching me, just drop me an email: fei.pan@my.cityu.edu.hk

Details of my research are listed in my [CV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fei-pan/fei_pan.github.io/master/FeiPAN_CV.pdf).

I collected several documents for Ph.D. students, and please check the [link](https://cryptpad.fr/drive/#/2/drive/view/skD-NRKvP2CLAuXha+b-XwLBAWPCc8Nuyek89eUZ7yg/). If there is any infringement, please notify me immediately. I believe that every successful research student knows how to visit the link if there was any problem.

I collected several tips for typesetting a Chinese LaTeX document, and please check the [article demo](https://www.overleaf.com/read/sqdcqrfzrzpf), the [CityU thesis template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mwpbypjxngvh), the [XJTU thesis template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/btmjxpfhjjwy), and the [beamer demo](https://www.overleaf.com/read/nbkkfgksmymq). I also made a straightforward [tutorial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fei-pan/fei_pan.github.io/master/pLaTeX-ng.pdf) on using the [pTeX-ng engine](https://github.com/clerkma/ptex-ng), a rising star for typesetting CJK documents.
