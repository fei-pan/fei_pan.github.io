## 路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索

Hi there, my name is PAN Fei (潘飞), a postdoctoral researcher at the Hong Kong Centre for Cerebro-Cardiovascular Health Engineering Limited (COCHE) located in the City University of Hong Kong.

This is my personal webpage. I am leaving Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, etc., but still need someplace to tell people how to find me and what happedned to me recently.

For reaching me, just drop me an email: fei.pan@my.cityu.edu.hk

For other informations about my research, please check my [CV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fei-pan/fei_pan.github.io/master/FeiPAN_CV.pdf)

I made a collection of tips for LaTeX typesetting in Chinese language, please check the [link](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rjjrqfthgzkc) and the [link](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gxmhsftsyzbh). I also made a very simple [tutorial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fei-pan/fei_pan.github.io/master/pLaTeX-ng.pdf) to use the [pTeX-ng engine](https://github.com/clerkma/ptex-ng), a rising star for typesetting Chinese documents.
